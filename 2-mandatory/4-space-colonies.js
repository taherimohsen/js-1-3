  The voyagers decide that they quite like this planet, and some of them want to settle there and colonise it.

  They call the planet "APS DNA" and they decide that the people whose carries the APS DNA tags after their names,
  which start with 'A' should stay,
  while the others go on in search of other planets to call home.

  Create a function that returns an array of colonisers that will stay, according to the above rules.

  NOTE: don't include any element that is not from "APS" family.

        Output: Is an array
        Logic: Only strings that start with A, and finish with Aps
